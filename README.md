#### Abstract:
This project provides the user with the ability to find all of their favorite psychedelic music genres in ONE place instead of having to search through Wikipedia and click on various buttons over and over again to find what they're looking for. For this project we worked as a group to write a program in React for the first time during Mod2 at Turing School of Software & Design. This was an opportunity to reinforce and solidify the concepts we had learned so far - JS fundamentals, OOP, working with large datasets, and developing workflows. We collaborated, created, and iterated on user stories. We constructed a complex dataset (we chose to do our project on psychedelic rock music as we were given autonomy over our datasets) and implemented array mutator and iterator methods to work with the data. 

---


#### Goals:
Provide a digestable UI and seamless, empathetic UX.

* Iterate over large dataset to provide user with information about different bands
* Give user ability to open and close band popup by clicking on band image
* Craft code with clean style by using modular components.

#### Challenges:
As this was our first project in React, we found ourselves struggling with the Fetch API and our overall understanding of asynchronous Javascript. 

---


#### Wins:
We all felt as though we learned a lot during this project by bouncing ideas off of one another, rotating driver-navigator, and utilizing divide and conquer towards the end of the project. We were able to walk away with a good understanding of how components talk to each other and 'data down, actions up' became more clear towards the end of the project. 

---


#### Wishlist Item(s):
We would like to provide the user with an auto-fill search bar to search through the bands and provide a popup of that individual band's respective information. It would also be nice to make the app more dynamic allowing the user to add bands as they wish to the scroll bar.
